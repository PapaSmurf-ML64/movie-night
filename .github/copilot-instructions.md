This project is a Node.js Discord bot for movie nights. It streams movies from Plex or Jellyfin, manages a schedule with slash commands, uses TheMovieDB API for movie verification, archives completed events, and supports event management (start, stop, refresh). Schedule is posted in a single message, with archiving to a thread. Saturday 8PM EST is default, but configurable.
